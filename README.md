## **ThingSpeak**

ThingSpeak serves as the IoT cloud platform for real-time monitoring, data visualization, and analytics in the Smart Watering System. Below is an overview of how the project leverages ThingSpeak for effective data management and insights.

### **Channel Configuration**
The ThingSpeak channel is set up with the following fields:  

- **Field 1:** Soil Moisture (%)  
- **Field 2:** Temperature (ÂºC)  
- **Field 3:** Humidity (%)  
- **Field 4:** Light Intensity (lux)  
- **Field 5:** Valve Duration (s)  

Fields 1 to 4 log real-time sensor data, while Field 5 records predictions from the Neural Network model, which estimates the valve duration based on sensor inputs.
### **MATLAB Visualizations**
ThingSpeak integrates MATLAB for advanced data visualization and analysis. Two MATLAB scripts are used for this project:  

1. **Scatter Plot:** Visualizes the relationship between soil moisture and valve duration.  
2. **KDE Heatmap:** Displays the kernel density estimation for temperature and humidity, revealing key environmental patterns.    

### **Widgets for Real-Time Monitoring**
A **gauge widget** is configured to track soil moisture levels at a glance, with states represented as:  
- **Red:** Danger zone (below 30% or above 70%)
- **Green:** Healthy range (50% to 60%)
- **Amber:** Warning zone (anything else)

### **Channel View**
The following figures illustrate the ThingSpeak channel for this project:

![ThingSpeak Results 1](https://github.com/Gonzaleski/Smart-Watering-System/blob/main/results/thingspeak/thingspeak_results_1.png) 

![ThingSpeak Results 2](https://github.com/Gonzaleski/Smart-Watering-System/blob/main/results/thingspeak/thingspeak_results_2.png) 


#### **Key Observations:**  
- The Soil Moisture vs. Valve Duration scatter plot highlights an inverse relationship: as soil moisture increases, valve duration decreases.  
- The Temperature vs. Humidity KDE shows the plant environment is typically in the 20â€“21Â°C range with ~60% humidity.

### **Automated Alerts and Actions**
ThingSpeak's MATLAB analysis scripts and TimeControl feature automate system responses:  
- A MATLAB script runs every 6 hours to check soil moisture levels.  
- If the soil moisture enters the danger zone (below 30% or above 70%), an email notification is triggered.  

### **Why ThingSpeak Matters**
- ThingSpeak enhances the Smart Watering System by turning raw data into actionable insights and enabling proactive system management:
- Real-Time Monitoring: Visualizations of real-world data allow for consistent and reliable plant monitoring.
- Data Interpretation: MATLAB visualizations provide deeper insights, helping to analyze and understand the collected data effectively.
- Automated Responses: The integration of MATLAB Analysis and TimeControl enables automated actions, such as sending alerts for waterlogged or excessively dry soil conditions.
- Critical Metrics at a Glance: Widgets simplify monitoring by highlighting essential metrics like soil moisture in an intuitive and accessible format.

## **Predictive Model Analysis**
The Smart Watering System leverages machine learning models to predict the optimal duration for activating the water pump based on environmental data. To ensure high accuracy and reliability, three models were evaluated:
1. Linear Regression
2. Random Forest
3. Neural Network

### **Training Phase**
The script, `scripts/train_models.m`, prepares the data, trains the models, and saves them for further analysis and use. The trained models are integral to optimizing water usage by predicting the precise duration for which the valve should remain open based on environmental conditions.

By leveraging MATLAB's robust computational tools, this script simplifies the process of developing, training, and evaluating models, ensuring consistency and accuracy at every step.

### **Model Evaluation Metrics**

The performance of these models was assessed using the following metrics:
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): Measures the average magnitude of prediction errors.
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Represents the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
- Residuals: Highlights the distribution of prediction errors.

The following figure presents the RMSE and MAE for each model:

![alt text](https://github.com/Gonzaleski/Smart-Watering-System/blob/main/results/plots/MAE_RMSE.png)

The Neural Network demonstrated the best performance, achieving the lowest MAE of 0.05 and RMSE of 0.07. This indicates that the Neural Network can make highly accurate predictions with minimal average error and few significant outliers.

The Random Forest model, while not as precise as the Neural Network, performed moderately well. With an MAE of 0.10 and RMSE of 0.15, it captured some non-linear relationships in the data but introduced more error compared to the Neural Network.

Linear Regression exhibited the highest error rates, with an MAE of 0.26 and RMSE of 0.32. This suggests that it struggled to model the complex relationships inherent in the data, likely due to its linear assumptions.

A comparative visualization of the models' RMSE and MAE is shown below, reinforcing the Neural Network's superior performance:

![alt text](https://github.com/Gonzaleski/Smart-Watering-System/blob/main/results/plots/MAE_RMSE_comparison.png)

### **Residual Analysis**
Residual analysis provides deeper insights into model performance by examining the differences between actual and predicted values. The next figure shows predicted vs. actual plots for each model, along with their respective residual plots.

![alt text](https://github.com/Gonzaleski/Smart-Watering-System/blob/main/results/plots/residuals.png)

- Neural Network: The predicted vs. actual plot for the Neural Network aligns closely with the diagonal line, reflecting high accuracy. The residual plot shows a symmetrical distribution around zero, with no discernible patterns, indicating a well-calibrated model.
- Random Forest: While the Random Forest predicted vs. actual plot shows some deviations from the diagonal, its residuals are also symmetrically distributed with no apparent patterns, suggesting reasonable accuracy despite minor inconsistencies.
- Linear Regression: Linear Regressionâ€™s predicted vs. actual plot reveals substantial deviations, and its residual plot shows a clear pattern with a positive slope. This suggests systematic errors and a lack of flexibility in capturing complex data relationships.

To facilitate a direct comparison, the following figure combines the predicted vs. actual values of all three models in a single plot and includes a distribution of residuals:

![alt text](https://github.com/Gonzaleski/Smart-Watering-System/blob/main/results/plots/residual_distribution.png)

The combined predicted vs. actual plot underscores the Neural Networkâ€™s accuracy, with its predictions clustered closest to the diagonal. Random Forest follows, while Linear Regression exhibits the greatest deviation.

The residual distribution plot further highlights the differences:

- The Neural Network has the highest peak and the narrowest domain, indicating tightly clustered residuals around zero.
- Random Forest has a lower peak and a broader spread, showing moderate variability in residuals.
- Linear Regression exhibits the lowest peak and the widest domain, reflecting larger and more inconsistent residuals.

Based on the evaluation of RMSE, MAE, and residuals, the Neural Network demonstrated the highest accuracy and consistency among the three models. It successfully captured the complex relationships in the data, making it the most suitable choice for the Smart Watering Systemâ€™s predictive model. This selection ensures optimal pump activation, minimizing water wastage while maintaining plant health.
